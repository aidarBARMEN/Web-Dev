    <h1>Betty Botter</h1>
    <p>Betty Botter bought some butter<br>
    But, said she, the butter's bitter.<br>
    If I put it in my batter,<br>
    it will make my batter bitter.<br>
    But a bit of better butter<br>
    will make my bitter batter better.<br>
    So she bought some better butter,<br>
    better than the bitter butter,<br>
    put it in her bitter batter,<br>
    made her bitter batter better.<br>
    So it was better<br> 
    Betty Botter bought some better butter.</p>
